Mangnet is a Android native manga reading app inspired by Tachiyomi (RIP üôè), so far it reads off of Mangadex's REST API to provide a way to download and read manga, allowing a few customizations to the search parameters, genre filtering etc.

# Author notes and project reasoning
Hello guys, my name is Marcus and I am a second year Computer Science student based in Australia, This project all started when at the start of 2024 when I wanted to do a coding project to place in my portfolio for future use, I have seen to many people and peers just copy projects off of youtube boiler plate portfolio projects and that just didn't seem right to me. 

I wanted to make something that I wouldn't just throw away after making, I wanted to create something meaningful, something I could use myself. At the same time however, Tachiyomi was wiped off the face of the Earth and I decided why not make a manga reading app? Obviously as a student fresh off of 1st year I was unable to do anything meaningful, not even knowing what a REST api was or state management. However over the long course of this project's development I learnt those skills via youtube videos and Google's Android Compose courses, allowing me to even have a slight grasp at what this project might look like.

Overall, I hope you guys are happy with this project, if you ever have the time to provide feedback do not hesistate and email [me](marcusolachan@gmail.com)

# Roadmap
In the future I will be adding notification support as well as support for reading manga off of other sources other than mangadex.

# Project Status
Since I am the only person developing this app right now, progress will be slow as I am juggling this project and Uni at the same time.
